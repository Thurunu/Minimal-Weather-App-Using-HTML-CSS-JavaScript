# Minimal Weather App Using HTML CSS JavaScript


I create this app for learn JavaScript Basics. I get the current weather data from Fess API fey from OpenWeatherMap and display the weather information like Temperature,  Weather condition, Humidity and Wind Speed according to the city. I get the weather info on website from Free API using JavaScript. In this weather app I add one search box where user can enter the city name and get the weather information of the particular city.
